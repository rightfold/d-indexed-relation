indexed-relation is a D library for indexed relations: bags of values with
efficient lookups on multiple independent keys.

** Usage example

For usage examples, see the unit tests in the source files.

** Implementations in other languages

A similar C++ library exists as part of the Boost project: the Boost Multi-index
Containers Library. In Haskell, the packages ixset and ixset-typed provide
similar functionality. You can also find indexed relations in any decent RDBMS.
